1. FILES

 1. If the ls command is unavailable you could use the dir command as an alternative.
 The dir command works by listing all of the folders and files in the directory
 in alphabetical order.

 2. To be prompted before a file is removed you would need to use -i and to not be prompted
 you would need to use the -f. If you use both the -i and -f at the same time the -f option
 would be used as it is given the higher priority

 3. The mv command changes the the name of the file called and it cal also change the location 
 to somewhere else. The rename command can change a bunch of file names at once instead of
 doing them each one by one

 4. ELF 64-bit LSB executable in this context means: Executable and Linkable Format and it 
 shows the structure (64-bit) for libraries, core files, and binaries.

 5. The ls -l command displays the size of the file that is called, while the du command just
 displays the amount of disk space  that is being used for the file that is being called.



2. DIRECTORIES

 1. The easier alternative is to simple enter mkdir -p grandparent/parent/child

 2. In order to make a directory with a space in it you need to add a "/", so if you wanted
 to make a directory with the file name "Computer Science". You need to enter
 mkdir Computer/ Science and if you wanted to delete it you can simply enter
 rm Computer/ Science

 3. You can simply enter mkdir -m 500 test   (test = name of file you want)

 4. You can simply enter cd .. which will go back up to the next parent directory

 5. You can simply enter pushd -N (N will be the number level)



3. PERMISSIONS

 1. You can view made modifications that chmod is making by using pipelines.
 EX: ___chmod___Command___Goes___Here | ls -l test.txt

 2. You can do this by copying ownerships between them:
 chown --reference=test1 test2

 3. The stat command alone is good enough to list all of the details

 4. You simple need to enter chmod 755 filename   (filename = The name of the file you want)

 5. If the users(u/g/o/a) flag are ommited the, default option is a. THe permissions set by umask 
 would not be affected.
